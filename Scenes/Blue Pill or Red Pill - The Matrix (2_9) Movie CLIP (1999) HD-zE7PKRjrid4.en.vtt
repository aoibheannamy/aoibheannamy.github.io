00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
Do you want to know... What it is?

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.540
The Matrix is everywhere.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.080
It is all around us.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.760
Even now, in this very room.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.800
You can see it when you look at your window,

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.620
or when you turn on your television.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.540
You can feel it when you go to the work,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.180
when you go to church,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.420
when you pay your taxes.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.920
It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes, to blind you from the truth.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.160
What truth?

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.840
That you are a slave, Neo.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.240
Like everyone else, you were born into bondage,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.700
born into a prison that you can not smell or taste or touch.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.940
A prison...

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.980
for your mind.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Unfortunately, no one can be...

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.600
told what the Matrix is.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.520
You have to see it for yourself.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.520
This is your last chance.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.400
After this, there is no turning back.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.500
You take the blue pill...

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.240
The story ends...

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.740
You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want believe.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.420
You take the red pill,

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.340
you stay in Wonderland.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.000
And I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.620
Remember...

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.460
All I am offering is the truth, nothing more.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.160
Follow me.
