00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:19.106
I knew it.

00:00:19.173 --> 00:00:20.440
He's the one.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.226
Do you believe it now,
trinity?

00:00:40.862 --> 00:00:42.029
Morpheus...

00:00:44.265 --> 00:00:45.298
The oracle...

00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:47.101
She told me--

00:00:47.168 --> 00:00:50.971
She told you exactly
what you needed to hear.

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.507
That's all.

00:00:53.574 --> 00:00:56.644
Neo, sooner or later, you're
going to realize just as I did,

00:00:56.711 --> 00:00:59.279
There's a difference
between knowing the path

00:00:59.347 --> 00:01:01.414
And walking the path.

00:01:03.384 --> 00:01:05.052
Operator.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.353
Morpheus: Tank.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.955
God damn, it's good
to hear your voice, sir.

00:01:08.023 --> 00:01:09.056
We need an exit.

00:01:09.124 --> 00:01:10.057
Got one ready.

00:01:10.125 --> 00:01:12.126
Subway station,
state and balboa.

00:01:24.973 --> 00:01:26.006
Damn it.

00:01:26.074 --> 00:01:27.474
The trace
was completed.

00:01:27.542 --> 00:01:28.942
We have their position.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.411
The sentinels
are standing by.

00:01:32.847 --> 00:01:34.581
Order the strike.

00:01:40.755 --> 00:01:43.090
They're not out yet.

00:01:43.158 --> 00:01:46.226

00:01:49.798 --> 00:01:51.832
[ring]

00:01:54.202 --> 00:01:55.535
You first,
morpheus.

00:01:55.603 --> 00:01:57.071
[ring]

00:02:13.454 --> 00:02:15.488
