00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.034
You have to save zion.

00:00:05.035 --> 00:00:07.169
I can't.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.040
Not without you.
Yes, you can.

00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:12.809
You will.

00:00:13.777 --> 00:00:16.979
I believe it.
I always have.

00:00:19.382 --> 00:00:21.083
Trinity.

00:00:23.286 --> 00:00:26.789
Trinity, you can't die.

00:00:28.792 --> 00:00:31.160
You can't.

00:00:31.161 --> 00:00:32.929
You can't.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.130
Yes, I can.

00:00:38.234 --> 00:00:40.736
You brought me back once.

00:00:42.873 --> 00:00:45.040
But not this time.

00:00:50.848 --> 00:00:52.815
Do you remember...

00:00:54.551 --> 00:00:57.553
On that roof,
after you caught me...

00:00:59.055 --> 00:01:00.923
The last thing
I said to you?

00:01:03.627 --> 00:01:05.194
You said, "I'm sorry."

00:01:06.463 --> 00:01:08.631
I wish I hadn't.

00:01:11.635 --> 00:01:13.970
That was my last thought.

00:01:16.339 --> 00:01:20.042
I wished I had
one more chance...

00:01:20.043 --> 00:01:22.344
To say
what really mattered.

00:01:24.882 --> 00:01:27.750
To say how much
I loved you.

00:01:30.086 --> 00:01:33.556
How grateful I was
for every moment I was with you.

00:01:36.292 --> 00:01:38.360
But by the time
I knew how to say

00:01:38.361 --> 00:01:41.296
What I wanted to,
it was too late.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.872
But you brought me back.
