00:00:08.538 --> 00:00:09.972
How is he?

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.142
10 hours straight.
He's a machine.

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:25.553
I know kung fu.

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:28.156
Show me.

00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:31.559
This is a sparring program,

00:00:31.627 --> 00:00:34.562
Similar to the programmed
reality of the matrix.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.098
It has the same basic rules,
rules like gravity.

00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.133
What you must learn

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.567
Is that these rules
are no different

00:00:39.635 --> 00:00:40.968
Than the rules
of a computer system.

00:00:41.037 --> 00:00:42.504
Some of them can be bent,

00:00:42.571 --> 00:00:45.507
Others can be broken.

00:00:45.574 --> 00:00:47.475
Understand?

00:00:48.377 --> 00:00:49.377
Then hit me...

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:51.279
If you can.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.757
Good!

00:01:43.825 --> 00:01:43.924
Adaptation,

00:01:43.992 --> 00:01:45.325
Od!

00:01:45.393 --> 00:01:46.927
Adaptation,

00:01:48.862 --> 00:01:50.296
Improvisation.

00:01:50.364 --> 00:01:51.696
But your weakness
improvisation.

00:01:51.764 --> 00:01:53.198
But your weakness
is not your technique.

00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:58.468
Chnique.
