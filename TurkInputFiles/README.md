# Turk Input Files Folder
This folder contains the input files used in the MTurk tasks performed, and contains the information for each HIT a worker would work on. The image links used in these files were hosted on the GitHub repository, and were accurate at the time of publishing the batches.
* **inputAvatar.csv** contains the HITs required for labelling the physical appearances of the characters chosen;
* The Spectacular Now files contain the frames from a scene from the film The Spectacular Now, duplicated for labelling of both the male and female characters;
    * Scene details were labelled here, such as character emotion, dialogue, props etc.

All MTurk tasks which include media elements (such as images, videos etc.) must have the variable names written as $_(image_url), and this is used in every .csv input file.
