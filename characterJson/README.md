# Character JSON Folder
This folder contains all character JSON objects which can be utilised in the visual novel.

The gangsters and joker json objects were combined together into the _batmanCharacters.json_ file, which was used to call the corresponding images inside the visual novel.

This provides a template for future scenes in the visual novel: by replciating the JSON file for different characters, the visual novel should be capable of loading it and portraying a new scene.
