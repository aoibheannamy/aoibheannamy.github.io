# Personality Folder
This folder contains all the webpages used in the personality side of the web application. These pages don't require much in order to update them, and for those with tables, a simple "add row" button could be added so users can add new data.
* **Good V Bad V Ambiguous**: This page contains the a short study of characters from twelve different universes from the Open-Source Psychometrics Project Statistical "Which Character" Personality Quiz based on whether they are classically good, bad or morally ambiguous. This page could be developed further with a button for users to add new data rows.
* **Hero V Villain**: This is a breakdown of the protagonists and antagonists from the Open-Source Psychometrics Project Statistical "Which Character" Personality Quiz matched with their Myers Briggs representation to see if there is a link between the personality type of a character and their legitimacy in their universe. Again, this page could be developed further with a button for users to add new data rows.
* **Matches from other Universes**: This is a short study of characters from the Open-Source Psychometrics Project Statistical "Which Character" Personality Quiz. The character's personality data was sourced and put back into the test again to see which characters from other universes they would be most akin to. Finding the closest matches in both protagonists and antagonists provides a good insight to how similar personality types can lead to completely different world views. A protagonist refers to the main hero in the story, an antagonist refers to the main villain, and a deuteragonist is a secondary character, right behind the protagonist in importance. The deuteragonist may be on the protagonist's side: for example, a love interest or sidekick. Or the deuteragonist can be a villain, like the protagonist's main rival. This page could further developed to add a form where a user can add in new characters.
* **Myers Briggs Description**: In the Myers-Briggs typology system, there are sixteen personality types consisting of four letters: E for Extrovert or I for Introvert, S for Sensor or N for Intuitive, T for Thinker or F for Feeler, and P for Perceiver or J for Judger. This is the breakdown for the characters from Open-Source Psychometrics Project Statistical "Which Character" Personality Quiz including a description of the sixteen personality types.  Again, this page could be developed further with a form for users to add new characters.
